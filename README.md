# java-discord-token-logger
Extracts Discord Tokens, Webcam, Desktop, and can log Network Information.

This project shouldn't be used for any criminal or juvenile purposes, this is only for educational purposes and wanted to try making a logger in java.
I added brow passwords, cookies, and history logging as well but I did not feel comfortable releasing this publicly due to the nature of how maliciously people may end up using it.

I want to reiterate this this project is strictly for educational purposes and to see how we can protect ourselves better
